I hope today reminds you just how special you are, not just to the world, but to me. I love you endlessly, and I’m so lucky to be yours.

          There’s something about your smile that gets me every time. It’s not just that it’s beautiful it’s the way it makes everything around me feel lighter. When you smile, it’s like everything else fades out for a second, and it’s just you. It reaches your eyes, it’s genuine, and it’s the kind of smile that stays in my mind even hours later. I catch myself thinking about it randomly, and it brings this weird calm over me. It’s crazy how something so simple can mean so much, but your smile does that to me. It makes me feel lucky, like if I can make you smile, I must be doing something right. That smile of yours it’s everything to me.

          Your kindness is one of the things I fell hardest for. It’s not the kind that’s loud or showy it’s quiet, gentle, and real. You care in a way that not many people do anymore. Whether it’s the way you listen when I’m going through it, or how you still give love even when you’re hurting yourself, it’s something rare. You make people feel seen, and you carry so much softness in a world that’s constantly trying to harden people. I love that about you. Being loved by someone as kind as you makes me feel like I’m worth something. It’s the kind of love that sticks, and I’ll never take it for granted.

          Your voice does something to me I can’t explain. The first time I heard it, I swear it felt like everything around me paused. It’s soft, calming, and there’s this warmth in it that makes me feel safe like no matter how heavy life feels, just hearing you speak brings me peace. Even when we’re not talking about anything deep, just your voice alone makes me feel closer to you. There’s comfort in it, like home. And when you laugh or say my name, it’s different. It hits deeper. I could listen to you for hours and never get tired it’s not just a sound to me, it’s a feeling. A feeling that I’m loved, that I’m yours, and that I never want to lose you.

You show up in ways big and small, whether it’s through your words, your actions, or just being there when I need you most. Loving me the way you do makes me feel seen, accepted, and truly lucky to have you in my life.

To my favorite person in the world Lumayah,

Happy Birthday, my love. 💖

Today isn’t just about celebrating the day you were born, it’s about honoring the incredible person you are and the beautiful journey we’ve started together. It’s been almost 100 days, and every single one has been filled with moments I never want to forget. From our late-night talks that feel like the whole world disappears, to the way your laugh lights up even the darkest days, to the small, sweet things you say that stay with me long after we hang up each one has touched my heart in ways I didn’t think were possible.

You’ve shown me a kind of love that feels both powerful and gentle, something I didn’t even realize I was missing until you came along. I want to celebrate you every day not just for your stunning beauty, but for your incredible heart, your quick wit, your endless kindness, and everything that makes you uniquely you.

I’m beyond grateful to have you in my life and even more grateful that you love me in return. You mean everything to me, and I can’t wait to keep making memories together.

Forever and always yours.
